-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
	I learned a great deal about boolean logic as well as using Multimedia Logic in order to simulate the parts of the lab. A lot of what was gone over in class was seen throughout this lab and I feel that the prompts reflect the information present throughout lectures.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
	Part A and Part B went without issues and were fairly striaght forward. I think my only issues throughout this lab was with part C due to inversion being a rather tricky concept. While not an insane difficulty, I definitely feel that it was doable. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
	I honestly feel that the lab as is did a very good job at testing knowledge of boolean logic and tehre isn't much else that would make it "better" per se, though if there were to be another added challenge of sorts, then I feel that it would allow students to explore their options.

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?(Not including course materials)
	No external reserouces were used throughout this lab. 

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
	This lab was done on my own. On occassion, my roommate would ask about how certain aspects of the software and truth tables (SOP/POS) worked, though nothing regarding specifics or parts of this lab was discussed.
