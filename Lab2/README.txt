-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
	Procrastination is never the solution to anything and I deeply regret my choices from the last week; Granted lots of unforeseen unfortunate events, I could've avoided it had I just been more responsible.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
	I would say that there were points in time where I feel like lots of online reserouces had helped a lot coupled with the in-person labs. I really wouldn't have gotten any of this had I not asked a couple of questions, and without the power of google.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
	I'd say it's a solid lab, however there're a couple of things here and there that feels like it stumped me more than others(Overflow & 4-bit comparator)

What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
	A couple of online examples of certain aspects like building a mux out of gates from a youtube video. I watched a couple videos and read some examples regarding overflow logic since I didn't quite get it initially but I feel like I have a stronger grasp of it now

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
	My roommate occasionally wanted second opinions on his thoughts on how to do a certain aspect of the lab and I'd be happy to say my thoughts on whether or not it would work. Nothing beyond the occasional "Hey do you think this would work"?
