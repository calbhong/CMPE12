-------------------------
The text of your prompts are stored in the processorâ€™s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
	0x1001000 - 0x10010040	
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
	Learning objectives of this lab are to familiarize myself with the aspects of MIPS as a start to assembly as well as learn the ins and outs of MARS for future labs. 
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
	Other than my poor time management, my biggest issue was the mild learning curve towards the start as I'm not too familiar with languages in which dictating what goes where within memory so that was tough at first.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
	I think this lab does exactly what it set out to do and I don't think there's much to necessarily improve on. If possible, I feel that the lab itself should follow more on a timeline that parallels lecture if possible.
What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
	Youtube, google, stack overflow, UW CSE378; I cannot stress how helpful external material has been for this lab as I really would not have been able to finish "in time" had it not been for extra material.

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
	I had asked a close friend of mine who attends University of Washington:Seattle for some initial advice on how to approach assembly. He provided me with some of his readings from his intro class as well as a primer(made understanding much much easier). Once again, roommate asked for a bit of advice though nothing beyond that.
